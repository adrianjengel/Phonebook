Final Project
Testing

=============
`The Phonebook`_
=============

Dictionaries play an important role in Python. Python ‘dict’ are mutable and can contain any data type. Dictionaries consist of pairs (called items) of keys and their corresponding values. The data may be structured and related with meaningful keys which opens a huge realm of program capabilities.

Personas
========

Personas are a tool used to contextualize user and acceptance stories and aid
in the communication of product requirements.

Ramona – Day Care Services
--------------------------

Ramona is 47 years old. She has her own day care center. The center provides caring services for children while their parent work or go to school.

Details
-------

Ramona loves working with children. She likes teaching and caring for them. She acquires satisfaction by making them feel at home while under her care.

Goals
-----

Ramona wants to have a way that can help her have easy and quick access to parent’s phone number by first names.

Problem Scenarios
=================

Problem scenarios are in-depth descriptions of situations particular
`Personas`_ would like to to improve. Effective problem scenarios describe the
problem at hand, the current alternatives or workarounds the user may employ
and the related value proposition.

How to find a contact by first name
-----------------------------------

To help Ramona find telephone numbers in her paper phone book.

Current Alternatives
--------------------

Ramona tries to put numbers in order as she receives them from the client. She makes most entries in her phone book in caps to better see them.

Value Proposition
-----------------

Create a dictionary with all contacts. The dictionary can be accessed quickly and easily by the client’s first name.

User Stories
============

A user story is a structured way of capturing a functional requirement from the
perspective of a specific user. User stories provide the context, intention,
and business case for each newly developed feature.

Ramona's Phonebook
------------------

As a day care facilitator, I want to be able to reach my clients easily and quickly in time of need. I want to access my phonebook by first names in order to contact them when warranted so that I can be able to keep up to date with any days a child may have a trip or doctor’s appointment or if an emergency arises while the child is under my care.
