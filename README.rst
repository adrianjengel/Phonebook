Ramona's Phonebook
------------------
As a day care facilitator, I want to be able to reach my clients easily and quickly in time of need. I want to access my phonebook by first names in order to contact them when warranted so that I can be able to keep up to date with any days a child may have a trip or doctor’s appointment or if an emergency arises while the child is under my care.
